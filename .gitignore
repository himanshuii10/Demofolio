# Dependency directories
# This is the most important one for any JavaScript project. The 'node_modules'
# folder contains all third-party libraries and can be huge. It should always
# be generated by running 'npm install', not stored in version control.
/node_modules

# Environment variables
# This file typically stores sensitive information like API keys, database passwords, etc.
# It should never be committed to a public repository. A template file,
# like .env.example, is usually committed instead for others to use.
.env

# Build output
# When you use build tools, they often compile your code into a 'dist' (distribution)
# or 'build' folder. This generated code should be ignored.
/dist
/build

# Log files
# Ignore any file that ends with .log
*.log

# Common OS-generated files
# These files are created by the operating system and have no relevance to the project code.
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Common editor-specific configuration folders
# These folders store your personal editor settings for the project.
# It's best to let other collaborators use their own settings.
